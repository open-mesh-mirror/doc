h1. Alfred-gpsd

Alfred-gpsd can be used to distibute GPS location information about your batman-adv mesh network. This information could be, for example, combined with Vis to visualize your mesh topology with true geographic layout. For mobile or nomadic nodes, Alfred-gpsd, can get location information from gpsd.  Alternatively, a static location can be passed on the command line, which is useful for static nodes without a GPS.
