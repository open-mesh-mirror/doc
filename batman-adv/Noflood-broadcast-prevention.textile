B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced tries to forward a multicast frame via one of its non-flooding features first. If none of them is applicable then batman-adv falls back to __classic flooding__.

However, with some applications dropping a packet might be more desirable than flooding. For instance if flooding a frame would lead to a high burden for disinterested nodes in the mesh, up to congestion in the worst case.
