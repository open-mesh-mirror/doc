h1. B.A.T.M.A.N. OpenWrt configuration

{{>toc}}

This page showcases some basic batman-adv configurations on OpenWrt including wireless & network setups. However, the goal is to provide not more than a starting point. For a full reference of the OpenWrt uci system please visit the official "OpenWrt uci documentation":https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci.

The configuration for the following common example is provided: One AP with a wireless adhoc interface is supposed to run batman-adv (essentially, the setup explained in our [[Quick-start-guide|Quick-start-guide]]).

h2. Batman-adv 2019.0-3 and newer

With batman-adv 2019.0-3, the OpenWrt package was modified to better integrate in the netifd infrastructure. It now provides three different protos:

* batadv_hardif
** network interface used by batadv meshif to transport the batman-adv packets
** its master interface is set to the batadv meshif
* batadv (meshif/softif)
** virtual interface that emulates a normal 802.3 interface on top
** encapsulates traffic and forwards it via the batadv hardifs
* batadv_vlan
** potential VLAN ID on top of batadv meshif
** allows filtering of traffic from specific VIDs

The wireless configuration in '/etc/config/wireless':
<pre>
config wifi-device 'radio0'
	option [..]

config wifi-iface 'wmesh'
	option device 'radio0'
	option ifname 'mesh0'
	option network 'bat0_hardif_mesh0'
	option mode 'mesh'
	option mesh_id 'mesh'
	option mesh_fwding '0'
	option mesh_ttl '1'
	option 'mcast_rate' '24000'
</pre>

It is assumed you configured the 'wifi-device' depending on your requirements and your hardware. The interesting part is the 'wifi-iface' stanza with its options:

* 'device' points back to your radio (wifi-device) interface
* 'ifname' allows you to specify an arbitrary name for your adhoc/meshpoint interface
* 'network' points to the corresponding stanza in '/etc/config/network'
* 'mode' defines the wifi mode - 802.11s mesh(point) in our case
* 'mcast_rate' helps to avoid low bandwidth routes (routes with a lower throughput rate than the mcast rate will not be visible to batman-adv)
* 'mesh_id' is a basic wireless settings (like an SSID) you might want to set to your liking

More information can be found in the "OpenWrt wireless configuration":https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless

The first step is to create the "batadv" mesh interface (in our case "bat0") in /etc/config/network with the optional list of options:

<pre>
config interface 'bat0'
	option proto 'batadv'
	## optional settings to override the defaults:
	option routing_algo 'BATMAN_IV'
	option aggregated_ogms 1
	option ap_isolation 0
	option bonding 0
	option fragmentation 1
	option gw_mode 'off'
	#option gw_bandwidth '10000/2000'
	#option gw_sel_class 20
	option log_level 0
	option orig_interval 1000
	option bridge_loop_avoidance 1
	option distributed_arp_table 1
	option multicast_mode 1
	option multicast_fanout 16
	option network_coding 0
	option hop_penalty 30
	option isolation_mark '0x00000000/0x00000000'
</pre>

The next step is to add actual network device has "batadv_hardif" to the "bat0"
batadv meshif. This is done by specifying a "batadv_hardif" interface section
per network device. Here we add eth0 and the mesh0 (from /etc/config/wireless)
to bat0. It is important to adjust the MTU of the batadv_hardif devices
to avoid fragmentation.

<pre>
# add *single* wifi-iface with network bat0_hardif_mesh0 as hardif to bat0
config interface 'bat0_hardif_mesh0'
	option proto 'batadv_hardif'
	option master 'bat0'
	option mtu '1536'
	# option ifname is filled out by the wifi-iface

# add eth0 as hardif to bat0
config interface 'bat0_hardif_eth0'
	option proto 'batadv_hardif'
	option master 'bat0'
	option mtu '1536'
	option ifname 'eth0'
	option 'elp_interval' 500
	option 'throughput_override' 0
</pre>

The "bat0" batadv meshif can then be used like any other network device. It
can be added to bridges by adding "bat0" to the list of "ifnames" of the bridge.
Or an IP can be configured using:

<pre>
# configure IP on bat0
config interface 'bat0_lan'
	option ifname 'bat0'
	option proto 'static'
	option ipaddr '192.168.1.1'
	option netmask '255.255.255.0'
	option ip6assign '60'
</pre>

VLAN specific options have to be configured in a separated stanza having protocol 'batadv_vlan'.

In this particular section the user has to specify the name of the VLAN interface (that will be automatically created by netifd) and then list all the wanted options. At the moment the only available option for this section is 'ap_isolation':

<pre>
config interface 'my_bat_vlan1'
	option proto 'batadv_vlan'
	option ifname 'bat0.1'
	option ap_isolation '1'
</pre>

Any VLAN specific option can still be listed in the batadv meshif configuration for 'bat0' and in that case they will affect the behaviour only for the plain mesh interface (i.e. bat0 - the untagged LAN).

h2. Batman-adv 2013.0.0 till 2019.0-2

With batman-adv 2013.0.0 the OpenWrt package was converted to integrate with OpenWrt's netifd system. This has some impact on the configuration but not much.

The wireless configuration in '/etc/config/wireless':
<pre>
config wifi-device 'radio0'
	option [..]

config wifi-iface 'wmesh'
	option device 'radio0'
	option ifname 'adhoc0'
	option network 'bat0_hardif_wlan'
	option mode 'adhoc'
	option ssid 'mesh'
	option 'mcast_rate' '18000'
	option bssid '02:CA:FE:CA:CA:40'
</pre>

It is assumed you configured the 'wifi-device' depending on your requirements and your hardware. The interesting part is the 'wifi-iface' stanza with its options:

 * 'device' points back to your radio (wifi-device) interface
 * 'ifname' allows you to specify an arbitrary name for your adhoc interface (which we are going to re-use later)
 * 'network' points to the corresponding stanza in '/etc/config/network'
 * 'mode' defines the wifi mode (adhoc in our case)
 * 'mcast_rate' helps to avoid low bandwidth routes (routes with a lower throughput rate than the mcast rate will not be visible to batman-adv)
 * 'ssid' and 'bssid' are basic wireless settings you might want to set to your liking

More information can be found in the "OpenWrt wireless configuration":https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless

The network configuration in '/etc/config/network' allows to specify batman-adv as protocol and the batman-adv interface name. It is also possible to add other interfaces (like eth0) to the same mesh interface:
<pre>
config interface 'bat0_hardif_wlan'
	option mtu '1532'
	option proto 'batadv'
	option mesh 'bat0'


config interface 'bat0_hardif_eth0'
	option mtu '1532'
	option proto 'batadv'
	option mesh 'bat0'
	option ifname 'eth0'
</pre>

The batman-adv configuration in '/etc/config/batman-adv' only contains the batman-adv specific options:
<pre>
config mesh 'bat0'
	option 'aggregated_ogms'
	option 'ap_isolation'
	option [..]
</pre>

*Since batman-adv 2014.2.0* VLAN specific options have to be configured in a separated stanza having protocol 'batadv_vlan'.

In this particular section the user has to specify the name of the VLAN interface (that will be automatically created by netifd) and then list all the wanted options. At the moment the only available option for this section is 'ap_isolation':
<pre>
config interface 'my_bat_vlan1'
	option proto 'batadv_vlan'
	option ifname 'bat0.1'
	option ap_isolation '1'
</pre>

Any VLAN specific option can still be listed in the batman-adv configuration for 'bat0' and in that case they will affect the behaviour only for the plain mesh interface (i.e. bat0 - the untagged LAN).


*Since batman-adv 2016.1*  The routing algorithm can be configured via the network configuration in '/etc/config/network' to override the kernel module's default:

<pre>
config interface 'bat0_hardif_wlan'
	option mtu '1532'
	option proto 'batadv'
	option mesh 'bat0'
	option routing_algo 'BATMAN_V'
</pre> 

h2. Batman-adv 2012.4.0 and older

The wifi interface needs to be configured in '/etc/config/wireless':
<pre>
config wifi-device 'radio0'
	option [..]

config wifi-iface 'wmesh'
	option device 'radio0'
	option ifname 'adhoc0'
	option network 'bat0_hardif_wlan'
	option mode 'adhoc'
	option ssid 'mesh'
	option 'mcast_rate' '18000'
	option bssid '02:CA:FE:CA:CA:40'
</pre>

It is assumed you configured the 'wifi-device' depending on your requirements and your hardware. The interesting part is the 'wifi-iface' stanza with its options:

 * 'device' points back to your radio (wifi-device) interface
 * 'ifname' allows you to specify an arbitrary name for your adhoc interface (which we are going to re-use later)
 * 'network' points to the corresponding stanza in '/etc/config/network'
 * 'mode' defines the wifi mode (adhoc in our case)
 * 'mcast_rate' helps to avoid low bandwidth routes (routes with a lower throughput rate than the mcast rate will not be visible to batman-adv)
 * 'ssid' and 'bssid' are basic wireless settings you might want to set to your liking

More information can be found in the "OpenWrt wireless configuration":https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless

Configure the MTU in '/etc/config/network'
<pre>
config interface 'bat0_hardif_wlan'
	option ifname 'adhoc0'
	option mtu '1528'
	option proto 'none'
</pre>

The stanza's name 'mesh' as well as the ifname option have to match your wireless configuration.

Batman-adv is configured through its own configuration in '/etc/config/batman-adv':
<pre>
config mesh 'bat0'
	option interfaces 'adhoc0'
	option 'aggregated_ogms'
	option 'ap_isolation' 
	option [..]
</pre>

The 'interfaces' option is the key element here, as it tells batman-adv which interface(s) to run on. All the other options enable / disable / tweak all the batman-adv features you can also access at runtime through batctl.
