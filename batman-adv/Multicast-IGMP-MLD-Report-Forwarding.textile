h2. Introduction

Currently batman-adv forwards/floods an IGMP/MLD Report to all other nodes by default. The _multicast_mld_rtr_only_ option allows to change this behavior to only forward IGMP/MLD Reports to nodes with a multicast router, to reduce IGMP/MLD overhead in the mesh. However this option is not always safe to use, so this page illustrates the scenarios where this option can and cannot be used.
