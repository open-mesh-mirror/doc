h1. batman-adv COMPAT_VERSION


COMPAT_VERSION in packet.h is used to identify an incoming packet and check if it can processed by the current version. The packet structure should be identified by this version. The stuff which appears in a packet jumps a little bit with each version because we change stuff in trunk/master and in next and import those changes to the packet structure out-of-order.

Following changes were identified and documented.
