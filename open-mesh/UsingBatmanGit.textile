h1. Using the batman git repositories

If you want to find out why we also have a git repository now, please read news#6.

h2. Clone

To retrieve the latest changes you can pull from the read-only http frontend.

<pre>
git clone https://git.open-mesh.org/batman-adv.git batman-adv
</pre>

There is also a repository for kernel integration. You are about to download 2GB of sources - that may take a while!

<pre>
git clone https://git.open-mesh.org/linux-merge.git -b batadv/net-next
</pre>

h2. Branches


The main git repository is divided into several branches to make working easier.

h3. main branch

The main branch will have all upcoming changes. Bugfixes are merged from stable to main.

h3. stable branch

The stable only gathers bug fixes for the last release.

Create branch associated with the remote-tracking branch after cloning the repository

<pre>
git switch -c stable --track origin/stable
</pre>

Cherry-picking a commit from main branch

<pre>
git switch stable
git cherry-pick $SHA1
</pre>

h3. Linux integration

The linux-merge repository is a clone of netdev's net-next tree. With the help of some git voodoo the main branch is merged with this branch in the folder: net/batman-adv/. If you wish to merge the latest main branch changes into the linux branch you need to [[batman-adv:SubmittingLinux|pull the newest changes in main from the batman-adv.git]] repository.
