h1. Emulation Setup

To give an answer to the often asked question "How to test/evaluate/debug mesh network protocols?", this document explains a virtual machine setup which can be used to test batman-adv in a controlled environment. The idea is to use "QEMU":http://www.qemu.org/ or "KVM":http://www.linux-kvm.org (instead of pure simulation systems like "NS-2":http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/) to run an unmodified Linux system with the unmodified source code as it is used in real world setups. Besides B.A.T.M.A.N., you could evaluate any routing protocol.

h2. Architecture

The test stack consists of the following components:

* "OpenWrt":https://openwrt.org/, kamikaze trunk version for x86 with minimal modifications (see below)
    you can also use chaos_calmer master version for x86, I think this version is better than kamikaze.
* one (unmodified) "QEMU":http://www.qemu.org/ instance per host (KVM or any other virtual machine)
* one (modified, see below) "vde_switch":http://wiki.virtualsquare.org/wiki/index.php/VDE_Basic_Networking per instance. You need multiple instances to allow interconnection with wirefilter.
* one (unmodified) "wirefilter":http://wiki.virtualsquare.org/wiki/index.php/VDE#wirefilter per link between hosts.


h3. OpenWrt

A standard OpenWrt can be downloaded and configured for X86. Some packages (tcpdump, netcat, batman-adv...) should be selected and kernel commandline parameters were modified to make sure that qemu boots up properly:
<pre>
noapic acpi=off
</pre>

Furthermore, to enjoy an automatic network device setup on boot you can use the following script (save it as './files/etc/rc.local' in your local OpenWrt build directory):

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# kill default openwrt network config
NUM=$(ip link show eth0 | awk '/ether/ {print $2}'| sed -e 's/.*://' -e 's/[\n\ ].*//')
ip addr add 192.168.$((0x$NUM)).2/24 dev  eth1
ip link set up dev eth1
ip link set down dev br-lan
ip link del dev br-lan


# setup batman, this step should be done before set up log server, otherwise it'll can't find log file
ip link set up dev eth0
echo "" > /proc/net/batman-adv/interfaces
echo eth0 > /proc/net/batman-adv/interfaces
echo 15 > /proc/net/batman-adv/log_level
ip addr add 192.168.0.${NUM}/24 dev bat0
ip link set up dev bat0

# set up log server

cat << EOF > /tmp/logserver.sh
#!/bin/sh
while [ 1 ]; do
	nc -l -p 2050 < /sys/kernel/debug/batman_adv/bat0/log
done
EOF
chmod 755 /tmp/logserver.sh
/tmp/logserver.sh&

</pre>

The script above is far from perfect, it takes some minutes after the rc.local file is finally started. Suggestions welcome.


h3. vde_switch

The main advantage of "vde_switch":http://wiki.virtualsquare.org/wiki/index.php/VDE_Basic_Networking over "uml_switch":http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/old/networking.html is that any clients can be attached to this virtual switch: QEMU, KVM, UML, tap interfaces, virtual interconnections, and not just UML instances.

If the vde_switches were just connected with wirefilter "patch cables" without modification, we would end up creating a broadcast domain and switch loops which we don't want: The goal is to allow the packets to travel only from one host to it's neighbor, not farther.

To accomplish this, the vde_switch needs to be modified to have "coloured" ports. The idea is:

* each port has a "colour" (an integer number)
* packets are only passed from ports to others with DIFFERENT colours.
* packets are dropped on outgoing ports if it has the SAME colour as the incoming port.

In this concept, the host port can have colour 1 while the interconnection ports have colour 0. This way, packets can only travel from the host to (all of) the interconnection ports, or from one interconnection port to the host port. However packets can not travel between the the interconnection ports, thus only allowing "one hop" connections and avoiding switch loops and shared broadcast domains. The concept is illustrated below:

!vde_switch.png!

You can find the patch against vde2-2.3.1 (current latest stable version) to add this colour patch here:

* attachment:vde2-2.3.1_colour.patch


h3. wirefilter


wirefilter is a tool where you can simulate various link defects and limits: 

* packet loss
* burst loss
* delay
* duplicates
* bandwidth
* noise (damage to packets)
* mtu
* ...

However as the links are only set up bidirectional, interferences can unfortunately not be simulated with this system.

For advanced testing it might be necessary to apply the aforementioned link defects to some packets only whereas other packets are able to traverse the emulated environment unharmed. Once you applied the 'ethertype' patch you can specify an ethertype which wirefilter will simply forward. To apply a packet loss of 50% to all packets except batman-adv packets, run:

<pre>
wirefilter --ether 0x4305 -l 50
</pre>

This patch also allows to filter batman-adv packet types. To apply a packet loss of 50% to all packets except batman-adv ICMP packets, run:

<pre>
wirefilter --ether 0x4305:02 -l 50
</pre>

You can specify up to 10 packet types (separated by colon). The patch against vde2-2.3.1 (current latest stable version) can be found here:
* attachment:vde2-2.3.1-wirefilter-ethertype.patch

h2. Scripts


The following script is used to start up all the qemus. It is a good idea to start the script inside a screen to have the QEMU instances in screen windows (which can be switch with ctrl+a n, ctrl+a p). Make sure that you have the correct sudo priveleges or alternatively run this script as root.

The script does:
* kill old instances
* start up vde_switch instances for each host
* start up QEMU hosts (one Ethernet tap device is created per instance to allow logging etc)
* install the links between the hosts. The resulting topology will be similar to this:

The script is using the switch configuration file "colourful.rc". It creates the ports (create more if your topology demands this) and sets the host port (port no. 1) colour to 1. Put the following text in this file:

<pre>
port/setcolourful 1
port/create 1
port/create 2
port/create 3
port/create 4
port/create 5
port/setcolour 1 1
</pre>


To collect the batman logs from the individual hosts, you might want to use this script after all nodes have completed booting and started batman:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
for i in $(seq 1 9)
do
	nc 192.168.${i}.2 2050 > num$i.log &
done
</pre>
