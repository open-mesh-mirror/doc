h1. Analyzing interconnect packets

h2. Wireshark

The easiest way to get the traffic of a virtual machine is via the tap interfaces. It is recommended to use the newest wireshark version (git master branch) to get support for batman-adv's packet format. Wireshark can then be started manually on a specific tap interface:

<pre>
wireshark -k -i tap1
</pre>

h2. View traffic via wireshark from virtual machine

It is not always possible to use the tap interface because either the packets are filtered somewhere in the path from/to the virtual machine. Or sometimes the packets are not even supposed to leave the virtual machine (for example with veth or hwsim). But is it also possible to start tcpdump inside the virtual machine via ssh and send the captured data to a local fifo (named pipe) on the host machine. Wireshark can read from the pipe and show the captured data

<pre>
mkfifo remote-dump
ssh root@192.168.251.51 'tcpdump -i enp0s1 -s 0 -U -n -w - "port not 22"' > remote-dump
wireshark -k -i remote-dump
</pre>
