h2. Git Repository Access

Since we started integrating the batman-adv kernel module into the mainline Linux tree, we maintain a git repository which contains the batman-adv maintenance branches. More information can be found [[UsingBatmanGit|on our git page]].
On overview about all the git repositories can be found on our "git frontend":https://git.open-mesh.org. We also host individual repositories for development related to batman or meshing in general. Feel free to contact us if you are interested in getting a repository too.

h2. batman-adv in the Linux tree


Since linux 2.6.33 batman-adv is part of the official linux tree. You can build batman-adv along with your linux binary by simply selecting batman-adv in the Linux drivers section. If you use an older kernel or want to have access to the latest features you can checkout our git repository which still are backward compatible until 2.6.29.

h2. Building OpenWRT packages


B.A.T.M.A.N. is also included in OpenWRT as a package. Download the extra package feed, link the batman folder into your main OpenWRT svn directory and use "make menuconfig" to select the B.A.T.M.A.N. flavor you intend to use. This enables you to integrate B.A.T.M.A.N. seamlessly into your builds (see [[batman-adv:building-with-openwrt|this page]] for a detailed explanation).

More information about how to build the OpenWRT toolchain is available "here":https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build.
