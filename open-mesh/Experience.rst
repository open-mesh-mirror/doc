Experience
==========

This page aims to provide a collection of links towards press reviews &
papers related to B.A.T.M.A.N. as well as projects using the
B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol in real live scenarios. This collection only
reflects a small percentage of the things out there because not
everybody contacts us to share his experience. If you have made some
experience or even setup a B.A.T.M.A.N. mesh network at someplace in
this universe please feel urged to :doc:`tell us <MailingList>` or drop us a
link!
