h1. DRAFT: Batman-adv 2025.4 released

*October 21nd, 2025*: The B.A.T.M.A.N. team is excited to announce the release of the October 2025 update for batman-adv! The network coding support was dropped due to its limited usefulness in todays Wi-Fi landscape and the neglected development in the related code portions. This release also includes various bug fixes and code cleanups.

Since the kernel module is always dependent on the specific Linux kernel it’s compiled against, providing precompiled binaries on our website is not feasible. As always, you can find the signed tarballs in the download section:
