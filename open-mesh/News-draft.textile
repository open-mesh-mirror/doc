h1. DRAFT: Batman-adv 2025.0 released

*February 7th, 2025*: The B.A.T.M.A.N. team is excited to announce the release of the February 2025 update for batman-adv! This update introduces support for subsecond ping intervals in batctl. To optimize OGM size, VLAN 0 is now treated as an "untagged VLAN," and announced TT changes now include fewer redundant modifications. Additionally, the OGM translation table changes parser in batman-adv has received a critical fix for a regression introduced in version 2024.4. This release also includes various bug fixes and code cleanups.

Since the kernel module is always dependent on the specific Linux kernel itâ€™s compiled against, providing precompiled binaries on our website is not feasible. As always, you can find the signed tarballs in the download section:
