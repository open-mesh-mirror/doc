h1. Experience

This page aims to provide a collection of links towards press reviews & papers related to B.A.T.M.A.N. as well as projects using the B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol in real live scenarios. This collection only reflects a small percentage of the things out there because not everybody contacts us to share their experience. If you have made some experience or even setup a B.A.T.M.A.N. mesh network at someplace in this universe please feel urged to [[MailingList|tell us]] or drop us a link!
