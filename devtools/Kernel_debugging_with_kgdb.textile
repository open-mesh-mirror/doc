h1. OpenWrt KGDB

{{>toc}}

As shown in the [[Kernel debugging with_qemu's GDB server]] documentation, it is easy to debug the Linux kernel in an [[OpenWrt_in_QEMU|emulated system]]. But some problems might only be reproducible on actual hardware ([[Mixing_VM_with_gluon_hardware|connected to the emulation setup]]). It is therefore sometimes necessary to debug a whole system.

In best case, the system can be [[Kernel debugging over JTAG|debugged using JTAG]]. But this is often not possible and an in-kernel gdb remote stub like "KGDB":https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kgdb.html has to be used. The only requirement it has on the actual board is a simple serial console with <code>poll_{get,put}_char()</code> support.

h2. Preparing OpenWrt

h3. Turning off watchdog

Most CPUs have some kind of watchdog integrated. They can often be turned off and are often inactive when the watchdog driver is not loaded. For example, ath79 can be build without the internal watchdog support by changing in <code>target/linux/ath79/config-*</code>:

<pre><code class="diff">
-CONFIG_ATH79_WDT=y
+# CONFIG_ATH79_WDT is not set
</code></pre>

Unfortunately, there are also external watchdog chips which cannot be turned off. They have to be manually triggered regularly during the debugging process to prevent a sudden reboot. The details depend on the actual hardware but it often ends up in writing to a specific (GPIO control/set/clear) register. An example how to manually trigger an GPIO connected watchdog manually can be found in [[GDB Linux snippets#Working-with-external-Watchdog-over-GPIO]]


It is also possible to stop the watchdog service at runtime without disabling the driver. This should work for many optional watchdogs in SoCs:

<pre><code class="shell">
ubus call system watchdog '{"magicclose":true}'
ubus call system watchdog '{"stop":true}'
</code></pre>

h3. Enabling KGDB in kernel

OpenWrt must be modified slightly to expose the kernel gdbstub (@CONFIG_KERNEL_KGDB@):

Subject: openwrt: Add support for easily selectable kernel debugger support

When enabling this KERNEL_KGDB (after disabling KERNEL_DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED),
make sure to clean some packages to make sure that they are compiled with
the correct settings:

    make toolchain/gdb/clean
    make toolchain/gdb/compile -j$(nproc || echo 1)
    make target/linux/clean
    make -j$(nproc || echo 1)

The serial console will be shared between normal serial output and (k)gdb,
it is necessary to have an agent installed on your host system which
extracts the part relevant for (k)gdb.

    git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/kgdb/agent-proxy.git/
    make -C agent-proxy
    ./agent-proxy/agent-proxy '127.0.0.1:5550^127.0.0.1:5551' 0 /dev/ttyUSB1,115200

It is then possible to see the full serial output in screen via:

    screen //telnet localhost 5550

On the target system, it is necessary to prepare the debugging session:

    echo ttyS0,115200 > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc
    ubus call system watchdog '{"magicclose":true}'
    ubus call system watchdog '{"stop":true}'

Sometimes it might be necessary to force Linux to switch to kgdb:

    echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger

The host can then connect to the kgdb using:

    cd "{LINUX_DIR}"
    cp ../vmlinux.debug vmlinux
    "${GDB}" -iex "set auto-load safe-path `pwd`/scripts/gdb/" -iex "target remote localhost:5551" vmlinux
    (gdb) lx-symbols ..
    (gdb) continue

h2. Agent-Proxy

KGDB(OC) is using the serial console - which is often already used as console output. Instead of us switching all the time between gdb and the terminal emulator (via UART/TTL), it can be rather helpful to use a splitter which can multiplex the kgdb and the normal terminal. So, instead of using screen/minicom/... + gdb against the tty device, the different sessions are just started against a TCP port.

h3. Installation

<pre><code class="shell">
$ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/kgdb/agent-proxy.git/
$ make -C agent-proxy
</code></pre>

h3. Starting up session

<pre><code class="shell">
$ ./agent-proxy/agent-proxy '127.0.0.1:5550^127.0.0.1:5551' 0 /dev/ttyUSB0,115200
</code></pre>

To connect to the console of the device, a simple telnet or telnet-like tool is enough:

<pre><code class="shell">
$ screen //telnet localhost 5550
</code></pre>

The gdb session will then later be started against the second port (5551)

h2. Start debugging session

h3. Turning off kASLR

The kernel address space layout randomization complicates the resolving of addresses of symbols. It is highly recommended to start the kernel with the parameter "nokaslr". For example by adding it to <code>CONFIG_CMDLINE</code> or by adjusting the <code>bootargs</code> in the bootloader. It should be checked in <code>/proc/cmdline</code> whether it was really booted with this parameter.

h3. Configure KGDB serial

The kgdb needs a serial device to work. This has to be set in the module parameter. We assume now that the serial console on our device is ttyS0 with baudrate 115200:

<pre><code class="shell">
echo ttyS0,115200 > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc
</code></pre>

h3. Switch to kgdb

The gdb frontend cannot directly talk to the kernel over serial and create breakpoints. The sysrq mechanism has to be used to switch from Linux to kgdb before gdb can be used. Under OpenWrt, this can be done using

<pre><code class="shell">
echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
</code></pre>

If your serial driver support <code>CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_SERIAL_SEQUENCE</code> then gdb can also trigger this automatically when using agent-proxy

h3. Connecting gdb

I would use following folder in my x86-64 build environment but they will be different for other architectures or OpenWrt versions:

* <code>LINUX_DIR=${OPENWRT_DIR}/build_dir/target-x86_64_musl/linux-x86_64/linux-6.6.73/</code>
* <code>GDB=${OPENWRT_DIR}/staging_dir/toolchain-x86_64_gcc-13.3.0_musl/bin/x86_64-openwrt-linux-gdb</code>
* <code>BATADV_DIR=${OPENWRT_DIR}/build_dir/target-x86_64_musl/linux-x86_64/batman-adv-2024.3/</code>

When kgdb is activated using sysrq, we can configure gdb. It has to connect via a serial adapter to the target device. We must change to the LINUX_DIR first and can then start our target specific GDB with our uncompressed kernel image before we will connect to the remote device.

<pre><code class="shell">
cd "${LINUX_DIR}"
cp ../vmlinux.debug vmlinux
"${GDB}" -iex "set auto-load safe-path scripts/gdb/" -iex "target remote localhost:5551" ./vmlinux
</code></pre>

If the connection was established, gdb will be able to communicate to kgdb on the target device. This is the right moment to load also the debug symbols from kernel modules - and then of course tell kgdb to switch back to Linux (via <code>continue</code>)

<pre>
lx-symbols ..

continue
</pre>

You should make sure that it doesn't load any <code>*.ko</code> files from <code>ipkg-*</code> directories. These files are stripped and doesn't contain the necessary symbol information. When necessary, just delete these folders or specify the folders with the unstripped kernel modules:

<pre>
lx-symbols ../batman-adv-2024.3/.pkgdir/ ../mac80211-regular/backports-6.12.6/.pkgdir/ ../button-hotplug/.pkgdir/
</pre>

The rest of the process works similar to debugging using gdbserver. Just set some additional breakpoints and let the kernel run again. kgdb will then inform gdb whenever a breakpoints was hit. Just keep in mind that it is not possible to interrupt the kernel from gdb (without a Oops or an already existing breakpoint) - use the sysrq mechanism again from Linux to switch back to kgdb.

Some other ideas are documented in [[GDB Linux_snippets]].

The kernel hacking debian image page should also be checked to [[Kernel_hacking_Debian_image#Building-the-batman-adv-module|increase the chance of getting debugable modules]] which didn't had all information optimized away. The relevant flags could be set directly in the routing feed like this:

h2. Enable KGDB on panic

Usually, a debugger catches problems like segfaults and allows a user to debug the problem further. On modern setups with kgdb, this is not the case because the system will automatically reboot after n-seconds.

This can be avoided by changing the sysctl config <code>kernel.panic</code> to 0. Either in /etc/sysctl.d/ or by manually issuing

<pre><code class="shell">
sysctl -w kernel.panic=0
</code></pre>

If a kgdb(oc) is attached then it should automatically receive a message when the Oops was noticed and can then be debugged further.
